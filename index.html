  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    Healthcare operator with <strong>15+ years of hands-on leadership</strong> across private medical centers,
    multi-specialty complexes, and healthcare networks in Qatar and the region.
  </p>

    <li>Revenue-cycle architecture</li>
    <li>Operational and workflow excellence</li>
    <li>Workforce structuring</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    My experience spans <strong>full lifecycle accountability</strong>; from concept and licensing of new medical
    facilities through operational stabilization, financial performance control, and strategic expansion or
    acquisition execution.

    <li>Executive accountability for facility-level P&amp;L performance</li>
    <li>Informed expansion, acquisition, or turnaround decisions</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="emphasis">
    I work inside strategic operations, not as an external consultant producing reports.
